**How children "get" religion from their parents**:  

religious socialization, religious inheritance, intergenerational transmission of religion
---
**Religious heterogamy**: interreligious marriage, partners do not share the same religion
  - two different religions
  - one religious, one nonreligious

Having interreligious parents is associated with *decreased* levels of religiosity in adulthood.
---
**Modeling**: children learn religion by observing and imitating their parents (Bandura & Walters 1977)  
<br>
**Channeling**: parents "channel" their children in to institutions, environments, and networks where they learn religion (Himmelfarb 1980).

---

1 - Parents "channel" their child into situations where he/she develops ties with others. This happens both incidentally and intentionally.

---

2 - The social ties into which parents channel their child are largely determined by the social ties of the parents themselves.

---

3 - The greater strength and number of ties to a religion the parents have, the greater strength and number of ties to a religion their child has.

---

4 - The greater strength and number of ties a child has to a particular religion, the greater likelihood the child adopts that religion.  

“To the extent that people have or develop stronger attachments to those committed to a religion in a different tradition, they will convert" (Stark & Finke 2000).

5 - Interreligious parents have different network structures than same faith parents.

---

5a - Same faith parents have a greater strength and number of ties to their religion because:  
  i - they are more religious.  
  ii - the two parents are more likely to have overlapping social networks.  
  iii - the ties the two parents do not share are still likely to be of the same religion.
---

5b - Interreligious parents have weaker and fewer ties to religion because they are less religious.  

5c - Interreligious parents are more likely to have distinctly separate networks of ties to religion.

---
**HYPOTHESIS 1a**:  
A child's social ties to a particular religion are stronger and greater in number when the parents have the same religion.

**HYPOTHESIS 1b**:  
A child's social ties to a particular religion are weaker and fewer in number when the parents do NOT share a religion.

**AND**, therefore, likely to be more/less religious.

---
**Summary**:  

Parents' ties strongly influence the ties of their child.  

If parents' networks include a lot of ties to particular religion, then the child will develop ties with them and eventually adopt that religion.

Because interreligious parents expose their children to fewer ties to a particular religion, their children are less likely to be religious.
