**How children "get" religion from their parents**:  
religious socialization, religious inheritance, intergenerational transmission of religion
---
*Religious heterogamy*:  
interreligious marriage, partners do not share the same religion

* two different religions
* one religious, one nonreligious

Having interreligious parents is associated with *decreased* levels of religiosity in adulthood.
---
*Modeling*: children learn religion by observing and imitating their parents (Bandura & Walters 1977)  
<br>
*Channeling*: parents "channel" their children in to institutions, environments, and networks where they learn religion (Himmelfarb 1980).

---

1 - Parents "channel" their child into situations where he/she develops ties with others. This happens both incidentally and intentionally.

---

2 - The social ties into which parents channel their child are largely determined by the social ties of the parents themselves.

---

3 - The greater strength and number of ties to a religion the parents have, the greater strength and number of ties to a religion their child has.

---

4 - The greater strength and number of ties a child has to a particular religion, the greater likelihood the child adopts that religion.

---

5 - Interreligious parents have different network structures than same faith parents.

---

5a - Same faith parents have a greater strength and number of ties to their religion because:
  i - they are more religious.
  ii - the two parents are more likely to have overlapping social networks.
  iii - the ties the two parents do not share are still likely to be of the same religion.

---

5b - Interreligious parents have weaker and fewer ties to religion because they are less religious.
5c - Interreligious parents are more likely to have distinctly separate networks of ties to religion.

---
**HYPOTHESIS 1a**: A child's social ties to a particular religion are stronger and greater in numbers when the parents have the same religion.  

**HYPOTHESIS 1b**: A child's social ties to a particular religion are weaker and fewer in number when the parents do NOT share a religion.
